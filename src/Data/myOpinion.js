    title: 'How Modi-Nitish won? Why Tejashwi-Rahul lost?',
    date: 'November 15, 2025',
    image: hero2Image,
    content: `In a stunning landslide win in Bihar, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar scored a three-fourth majority by winning 202 seats in the 243-member assembly. Nitish Kumar is going to be sworn in as chief minister for the tenth time.

The Mahagathbandhan led by Lalu Prasad Yadav's son Tejashwi Yadav lost badly. The alliance could win only 35 seats.

The final tally: NDA : 202 (BJP 89, Janata Dal-U 85, Chirag Paswan's LJP – 19, Jitanram Manjhi's HIndustani Awam Party 5 and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Morcha -4).

Mahagathbandhan: 35 (RJD 25, Congress 6, CPI-ML Liberation 2, IIP -1, CPI-M – 1). Out of the remaining six seats, Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM won five seats, while the sixth seat was won by Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party.

Clearly, Modi's magic and Nitish's leadership worked. BJP's strike rate was 90 per cent.

The Mahagathbandhan's campaign was disoriented right from the beginning and it was reflected in the results. Mukesh Sahni, who claims to be Son of Mallah, and was projected as Deputy CM face, scored a nought.`

    content: `बिहार चुनाव के नतीजे आ गए. NDA की ऐतिहासिक जीत हुई. महागठबंधन की ऐतिहासिक हार हुई. नरेन्द्र मोदी का मैजिक चला, नीतीश कुमार का नेतृत्व जीता.

90 परसेंट ट्राइक रेट के साथ बीजेपी बिहार में सबसे बड़ी पार्टी बन गई. जनता दल यूनाइटेड ने 85 सीटों पर परचम लहराया. चिराग पासवान ने 19 सीटें जीत कर कमाल कर दिया.

दूसरी तरफ महागठबंधन में जिस तरह का बिखराव कैंपेन के वक्त दिख रहा था, वैसा ही बिखराव नतीजों में दिखा. कोई यहां गिरा, कोई वहां गिरा. RJD सिर्फ 25 सीटों पर सिमट गई.`

    content: `The World Cup winning Indian women's cricket team met President Droupadi Murmu on Thursday.

The players displayed their trophy to the President, who congratulated them on their historic win. Captain Harmanpreet Kaur gifted a jersey signed by all Team India players to the President. Murmu said, this win will surely inspire crores of daughters in India to come out and play cricket.

The meeting with the President was formal because of Rashtrapati Bhavan protocol, but their tete-a-tete with Prime Minister Narendra Modi the previous night at the PM's residence was jovial and informal. Modi met the players like a friend and the meeting lasted 90 minutes.

Modi attentively heard the players who spoke about their experiences during the tournament. As players started narrating their dressing room tales, player Harleen Deol asked Modi about the secret of glow on his face. The Prime Minister had a hearty laugh.`
